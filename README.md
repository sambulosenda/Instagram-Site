Instagram clone! This React project has multiple pages: login, sign up, dashboard (to view/like/comment on photos), and user profiles. The sign-in page connects to Firebase when a user tries to sign in, and when a user signs up, we will use Firebase auth to store the user in the Firebase auth database. 

Built with React, JavaScript, Firebase and for styling I used Tailwind CSS
